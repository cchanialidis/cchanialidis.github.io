title: About me
---

I am an ex-academic turned data scientist working in financial services with  a background in statistical research. I have a wide-ranging technical experience in statistical machine learning, with particular expertise in predictive modelling, Bayesian statistical modelling, quantile regression and classification techniques.


Prior to working in data science, I spent three years as a lecturer of Statistics at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/). During that time I was the programme director of the [online MSc in Data Analytics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/dataanalyticsonline/). 

Before that, I was a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the University of Glasgow in the School of Mathematics and Statistics and the [Urban Big Data Centre](https://www.ubdc.ac.uk/). Even before that, I was a Post Doctoral Research Fellow at the [University College Dublin](https://www.ucd.ie/) in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics]( https://www.ucd.ie/mathstat/) and a PhD student of Statistics at the University of Glasgow in the School of Mathematics and Statistics. I obtained my MSc degree in Statistics and Operational Research at the [University of Athens](https://www.uoa.gr/). I obtained my BSc degree from the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.uoa.gr/) at the same University.
